    testimonial:
      "I have worked with Suhyun on the official website redesign project. Suhyun's greatest strength in taking responsibility for the development tasks on the front-end throughout the website development process was her ability to communicate quickly and clearly. Despite the tight deadlines, she accurately shared every step of the process to create a high-quality product within the given time frame. Thanks to her support, I was able to efficiently carry out my tasks as a designer.\nAnother strength of Suhyun is her attitude of continuously striving to improve as a developer. She genuinely love development and continuously pursue further development studies to create products that can deliver a better user experience. As a colleague working together, I was greatly inspired by her efforts to enhance her work abilities. Additionally, I have often regarded her as a positive team player who shares meaningful insights gained during the product development process with other colleagues.",
